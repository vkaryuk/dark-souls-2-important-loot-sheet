# Dark Souls 2 Important Loot Sheet
A checklist of items I find significant to a playthrough of DS2 and DS2: SOTFS. The items are sorted in order of difficulty to acquire, lower items in a section are considered more "late-game".

## Dark Souls 2: Scholar of the First Sin
### Sublime Bone Dust x5
*Burn at Majula bonfire. Each upgrade increases the health restoration of the Estus Flask by 50 HP. The maximum Estus Flask bonus is +5. After it is reached, the dust can still be obtained in new games but trying to upgrade the flasks further will only show a dialog telling you "Cannot burn further items". However, it is not entirely useless as it can be sold to Lonesome Gavlan for 1,800 souls each.*
- [ ] **1 - Majula**: Wear the Silvercat Ring and drop down to the lowest platform of the pit in the middle of Majula. Before the Gutter there will be a water-filled area with exploding mummies, the item is in the metal chest where the Great Heal Excerpt used to be in DS2.
- [ ] **2 - No Man's Wharf**: In the passages from Heide's Tower of Flame after the Tower of Flame bonfire above the Dragonrider boss, but before taking the elevator downwards.
- [ ] **3 - Shaded Woods**: From the Shaded Ruins bonfire, go up the ramp and make a jump to the area with a ruined building and a petrified lion warrior. No need to use Fragrant Branch of Yore here, but you need one to unpetrify Rosabeth of Melfia to unlock the Shaded Woods area.
- [ ] **4 - Huntsman's Copse**: From the Bridge Approach bonfire, head to the domed building on the right containing Soul Spear after the first bridge.
- [ ] **5 - Drangleic Castle**: After entering the castle go behind the curving staircases to a hallway with knights, make a left turn to a knight guarding a door, will be behind the door in a metal chest.
