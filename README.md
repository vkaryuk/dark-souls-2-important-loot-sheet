# Dark Souls 2 Significant Loot Sheet
A checklist of items I find significant to a playthrough of DS2 and DS2: SOTFS. The items are sorted in order of difficulty to acquire, lower items in a section are considered more "late-game".

## Dark Souls 2: Scholar of the First Sin
### Sublime Bone Dust
- [ ] **Majula**: Wear the Silvercat Ring and drop down to the lowest platform in the pit before the Gutter. Will be in an area with exploding hollows in a metal chest where the Great Heal Excerpt used to be in DS2.
- [ ] **No Man's Wharf**: In the passages from Heide's Tower of Flame after the bonfire above the Dragonrider boss, but before taking the elevator downwards.
- [ ] **Shaded Woods**: From the Shaded Ruins bonfire, go up the ramp and make a jump to the area with a ruined building and a petrified lion warrior. No need to use Fragrant Branch of Yore here, but you need one to unpetrify Rosabeth of Melfia to unlock the Shaded Woods area.
- [ ] **Huntsman's Copse**: From the Bridge Approach bonfire, head to the domed building on the right containing Soul Spear after the first bridge.
- [ ] **Drangleic Castle**: After entering the castle go behind the curving staircases to a hallway with knights, make a left turn to a knight guarding a door, will be behind the door in a metal chest.
