# Dark Souls 2 Significant Loot Sheet
A checklist of items I find significant to a playthrough of DS2 and DS2: SOTFS.

# Dark Souls 2: Scholar of the First Sin
[ ] Majula: Using the Silvercat Ring jump to the lowest platform in the pit before the Gutter. Will be in an area with exploding hollows, in a metal chest where the Great Heal Excerpt used to be in DS2.
[ ] No Man's Wharf: In the passages from Heide's Tower of Flame after the bonfire above the Dragonrider boss, but before taking the elevator downwards.
[ ] Shaded Woods: From the Shaded Ruins bonfire, up the ramp and make a jump to the area with a ruined building and a petrified lion warrior. No need to use Fragrant Branch of Yore.
[ ] Huntsman's Copse: From the Bridge Approach bonfire, head to the domed building on the right containing Soul Spear after the first bridge.
[ ] Drangleic Castle: After entering the castle go behind the curving staircases to a hallway with knights, make a left turn to a knight guarding a door, will be behind the door in a metal chest.
